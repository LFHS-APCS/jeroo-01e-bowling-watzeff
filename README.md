In Jeroo.java, write the method ```setupBowling()``` that will put out the pins using flowers with a Jeroo that starts at (0, 0) facing EAST.   

IMPORTANT: Do not put all the code in this one method. You should try to design a more elegant solution with helper methods.  

IMPORTANT:  In your helper methods, you can only use:          
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```
* ```turn(LEFT)```
* ```turn(RIGHT)```

If using the https://jeroo.org web site, then your Main program will look like:  
```
      method main() {  
        Jeroo kim = new Jeroo(0, 0, EAST, 100);  
        kim.setupBowling();  
      }
```
